	    <h1>Who we are</h1>
	    <h2>Mission and approach</h2>
	    <p>
	    	Raising the Floor is an organization of diverse people from industry, academia, NGOs and other 
	    	sectors who have come together to ensure that people who face barriers due to disability, literacy, 
	    	digital-literacy, and aging are able to fully understand, access, and use the digital world we are 
	    	creating (the web, computers, tablets, phones, educational materials, ticket machines, thermostats, 
	    	and even home appliances).
	    </p>
	    <p>
	    	Because information and communication technologies (ICT) are required for most activities in our 
	    	daily lives today, those who do not have access or have difficulties using ICT are excluded from 
	    	having these opportunities.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	    	RtFâ€™s one-size-fits-one is a fresh approach to accessibility and digital inclusion, offering greater 
	    	choices to people, asserting their right to access the digital world anywhere, anytime and in more 
	    	affordable ways.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	    	Its <Link to="/what-we-do">central focus</Link> is the development of the 
	    	<a href="https://gpii.net">Global Public Inclusive Infrastructure (GPII)</a>, a 
	    	cloud based solution that allows for the creation, discovery and use, of one-size-fits-one access to 
	    	technologies. 
	    </p>
	    <h2>Who benefits from the GPII?</h2>
	    <p>Consumers, developers companies, organizations, public institutions and all persons and organizations 
	    interested in ensuring access to ICT by all.</p>
	    <p>We focus on ensuring access to information and communication technologies by anyone who has difficulties 
	    using them. The list includes those with limited or no literacy, people with disabilities or functional 
	    limitations, and those who face aging related barriers to access and use of digital technologies.</p>

	    <h2>
	    	About the <abbr title="Raising the Floor">Raising the Floor</abbr> community
